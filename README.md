# d-headspace
## Survival and development through concentration.

D Headspace is a three-dimensional third-person action rpg with space fighting
dynamics in an abstract thought process environment. 


The goal of the game is to help the
thought born in the mind of its owner to develop, to confront difficulties and Fears
and to materialize in the allotted time.


For this, the player controls an abstract entity symbolizing an idea or thought that
avoids confronting the Fears that haunt it, destroys obstacles in its path, and strives
to survive and become stronger during a dramatically significant 21 days of practice
for the average person.


The game is developed for the PC Windows platform using the Unity 3D
development environment as part of the University of Bremen's Entertainment
Computing course.


The game is intended for a single player and consists of chapters united by a
common plot. It is designed in the abstract aesthetic of a minimalistic psychological
(psychedelic) thriller: an environment in which absurdity and symbolism seek to
evoke in the player vivid associations with real-life events and emotional
experiences.
